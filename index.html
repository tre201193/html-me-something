    <h2>What is autophagy?</h2>
    <p>Autophagy is basically our body's natural way of getting rid of our damaged cells, so we can replace them with newer, healthier cells. The literal definition when you break down the prefix/suffix of Autophagy is "self eating". This may sound quite harsh, but it's perhaps one of the most neccesary processes of the human body. It is our natural self-preservation mechanism through which the body can recycle dysfunctional cells toward cellular repair. </p>

        <p>The main benefits of autophagy come in the form of anti-aging principles. It's the body's way of turning back the clock and creating younger cells. When our cells are stressed, autophagy is increased to protect us which directly helps enhance your lifespan. Autophagy sadly declines as we age, so cells that don't function, or may harm our system are able to multiply. This is how cancer cells do most of their damage. </p>

        <h3>My experience</h3>
        <p>During my junior college days I lived with my mom, my aunt Chomanese, and her three sons. These were my first few years providing for myself. As many of us know these years are filled with a whole lot of trial and error, and finding what works best for you individually. Learning to cook, I did what most young men do, I cooked what I knew I would eat, and for me that happened to include cooking bacon on the DAILY. At that time I had no care in the world about diet, and how that may be effecting my health. Well not everyone in my house was lucky enough to live so carefree. My aunt was terminally ill at the time and would constantly lecture me about diversifying my food choices. It wasn't until she lost her battle with cancer that her words finally sunk all the way in for me. </p>
        <p>Through the grieving process, I was able to re-connect with those lectures I recieved from Chom. They were finally starting to sink in, I had long talks with many of my friends and I knew what I had to do. I challenged myself to try going Vegetarian for a full month. The first week of that month was by far the most challenging, I didn't know what to eat that would make me feel full. I resorted to intermittent fasting in an attempt to curb my appetite. Up until that point I always remember being so finicky about the food I chose to eat, but after fasting intentionally for the first time, I was 100% satisfied eating things I previously would've griped about. Including but spinach,  not limited to raw bell peppers,chickpeas, and kale. This was more than enough proof for me to include at least a week of intermittent fasting per month into my life, solely for the purpose of forming healthy habits. To this day I continue this practice, and firmly believe that "Autophagy", will improve the health of anyone who is willing to give it a try. </p>
